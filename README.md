# day-23_turtle_crossing
Day 23 of 100.

Why did the turtle 🐢 cross the road? To get teleported to his starting position. The only key that registers is the up arrow. Anything else would be too easy. Also, each level will increase the speed of the 'cars'. The player, cars, and scoreboard all have their own dedicated classes that were all imported into main.py
